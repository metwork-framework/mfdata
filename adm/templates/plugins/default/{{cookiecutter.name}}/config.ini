# the current module version is used

# (one section [step_xxxxx] for each step)
[step_main]
# You can have several blocks [step_xxxx] if your plugin
# contains several steps.
# If you have only one step in your plugin, please use "main" as your
# step name in [step_xxxxx]. So just one [step_name] section in this case.

# You can use following placeholders:
# - {% raw %}{{ENV_VAR}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the
#     corresponding env var.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_NAME}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the plugin name
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_NAME}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the step name
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_DIR}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the plugin
#     directory fullpath.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_CONFIG_INI_PATH}}{% endraw %}: replaced by this
#     file fullpath.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_QUEUE}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the name of
#     the queue for the plugin/step on redis
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_DIR}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the step
#     directory

# Command (without args) which implements the step daemon
# Note: it's not the command called for each incoming file, it's a daemon
#       implemented with Acquisition framework in Python ; if you want to
#       execute a binary command for each incoming file, please bootstrap
#       a "fork" plugin

# before killing it. When stopping a process, we first send it a TERM signal.
# A step may catch this signal to perform clean up operations before exiting.
# If the worker is still active after graceful_timeout seconds, we send it a
# KILL signal. It is not possible to catch a KILL signal so the worker will stop.
# If you use the standard Acquisition framework to implement your step, the
# TERM signal is handled like this: "we don't process files anymore but we
# try to end with the current processed file before stopping". So the
