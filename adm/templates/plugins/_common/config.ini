# If you have more than one step, use block step_section and included blocks
# for the first one and block extra_steps for the others

# You can use following placeholders:
# - {% raw %}{{ENV_VAR}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the
#     corresponding env var.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_NAME}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the plugin name
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_NAME}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the step name
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_PLUGIN_DIR}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the plugin
#     directory fullpath.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_CONFIG_INI_PATH}}{% endraw %}: replaced by this
#     file fullpath.
# - {% raw %}{{MFDATA_CURRENT_STEP_QUEUE}}{% endraw %}: replaced by the name of
#     the queue for the plugin/step on redis
