# MetWork/mfdata cheatsheet



## `root` service commands

As `root` unix user:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `service metwork start` | start all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork stop` | stop all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork status` | check all installed metwork services |
| `service metwork start mfdata` | start mfdata metwork services |
| `service metwork stop mfdata` | stop mfdata metwork services |
| `service metwork status mfdata` | check mfdata metwork services |

> Note: if you don't have `service` command on your Linux distribution, you can use `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork` instead of `service metwork`. For example: `/etc/rc.d/init.d/metwork start` instead of `service metwork start`. If your Linux distribution uses `systemd`component, you can also start metwork services with classic `systemctl` commands.



## root files or directories

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfdata/config.ini` | override the `mfdata` module configuration at system level (note: the first line of this file must be `[INCLUDE_config.ini]`) |
| `/opt/metwork-mfdata/config/config.ini` | default `mfdata` module configuration (**do not edit this file** => use the overriding previous file) |
| `/etc/metwork.config.d/mfdata/external_plugins/` | put some `.plugin` files here and they will be installed during `mfdata` service startup |

| `/opt/metwork-mfdata/bin/mfdata_wrapper {YOUR_COMMAND}`| FIXME |
